                        <h3>Nakoda Language Project</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Nakoda Language Project began decades ago as IU anthropologists worked with native Nakoda speakers across many communities of the upper Plains to document the language.
                            Beginning in 2015 I worked on a team to create materials to develop Nakota language speakers. By using the traditional stories of past elders we sought to develop literacy by passing down the full richness of this vibrant community. As a member of the Nakoda Language Project I created app interfaces, designed storybooks using traditional stories and developed textbooks and teacher's manuals.

                        <h3>Avalon Media System</h3>
                        <p>
                            Avalon Media System is an open source system for managing and providing access to large collections of digital audio and video. The freely available system enables libraries and archives to easily curate, distribute and provide online access to their collections for purposes of teaching, learning and research. 
                            The Avalon Community is made up of a dozen educational, media and open-technology institutions. As the Lead UX Designer I created interfaces, developed personas and worked with clients to analyze user-needs for the repository.

                        <h3>Red Cloud Indian School</h3>
                        <p>
                            In 2007, Red Cloud Indian School launched the Lakota Language Project (LLP) with the American Indian Studies Research Institute at Indiana University as a means of promoting and revitalizing the Lakota language and culture through curriculum development, community engagement and culturally-relevant education.
                            Historically an orally transmitted language there are now fewer than 6,000 fluent Lakota speakers. We created a youth-focused, comprehensive language curriculum to contribute to revitalizing the language.
                            I was responsible for working with materials developers to create the textbooks for all thirteen grade levels.
